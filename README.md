fun fact about me: 
1. I am pretty bad at dancing even tho i can sit and visualize all the moves. Infact i dance better when I'm seated than standing.
2. I don't know how to take pictures, reason why you'll never see me post myself on social media ðŸ¤¦
3. I don't eat frequently but i eat alot ðŸ˜‚ sometimes once a day but that one meal is some people's two days food. I eat one loaf of bread when I'm less hungry ðŸ˜‚
4. I make friends easily, I can't be in a place and not have friends that's not just me.
5. I really love playing boards games, Scrabble is my favourite, yet to learn chess well tho
6. I used to be an active partaker in online giveaways, there's literally nothing i haven't won online ðŸ˜‚ but since i left service the hustle has left ðŸ˜© December was usually my hit period hampers errwhere ðŸ˜‚
7. I don't like getting people upset that's why it takes a while for me to get comfortable with anyone. I take my time to study people before playing any type of play with them.
8. I am extremely happy to help people, i can literally go out of my way just so you're good without expecting anything in return. My friend once told me this will make me a poor man ðŸ¤£ so I'm thinking of monitizing my help
9. I can't work in an eatery because i fear i might eat as much as the customers in a day ðŸ˜¹ i just love eating something.
