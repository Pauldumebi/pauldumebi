Fun facts about me: 
1. I am pretty bad at dancing even tho I can sit and visualize all the moves. I dance better when I'm seated than standing.
2. I suck at taking pictures, reason why you'll hardly see me post about myself on social media ðŸ¤¦
3. I make friends easily, I can't be in a place and not have friends that's not just me.
4. I love playing board games, Scrabble is my favourite, yet to learn chess well.
5. I don't like getting people upset that's why it takes a while for me to get comfortable with anyone. I take my time to study people before getting involved with them.
6. I am extremely happy to help people, I can go out of my way just so you're good without expecting anything in return. My friend once told me this would make me a poor man ðŸ¤£ so I'm thinking of monetizing my help
